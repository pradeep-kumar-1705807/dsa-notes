# Queue Pattern

The queue pattern uses a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure, often for level-order traversal or scheduling tasks.

## Problem Patterns in Queue

- **Level Order Traversal (Basic)**
  - Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
  - N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS) (Basic/Intermediate)**
  - Number of Islands (BFS)
  - Shortest Path in Binary Matrix
  - Word Ladder

- **Sliding Window Maximum (using deque) (Intermediate/Advanced)**
  - Sliding Window Maximum

- **Task Scheduling / Order of Processing (Intermediate/Advanced)**
  - Course Schedule
  - Course Schedule II
  - Task Scheduler

## General Approach
1. Use a queue to store elements to be processed.
2. Enqueue new elements as they are discovered.
3. Dequeue and process elements in FIFO order.
