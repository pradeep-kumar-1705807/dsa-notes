# Greedy Pattern

Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping to find a global optimum.

- **When to Use**: Problems where local choices lead to a global solution, often with sorting or priority queues.
- **Key Insight**: Always pick the best available option at each step.
- **Example Problems:**
  - Coin Change (Greedy version)
  - Jump Game
  - Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons
  - Activity Selection
- **General Approach:**
  1. Sort or prioritize elements as needed.
  2. Make the optimal local choice at each step.
  3. Continue until the problem is solved or all elements are processed.
