# Stack Pattern

The stack pattern uses a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure to solve problems involving nested or sequential operations.

## Problem Patterns in Stack

- **Parentheses Matching / Expression Evaluation**
  - Valid Parentheses
  - Min Add to Make Parentheses Valid
  - Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

- **Monotonic Stack**
  - Daily Temperatures
  - Next Greater Element I/II
  - Largest Rectangle in Histogram

- **Backtracking with Stack**
  - Basic Calculator
  - Decode String

- **Stack for History/Undo**
  - Browser History
  - Simplify Path

## General Approach
1. Use a stack to store elements or indices.
2. Push new elements as you process input.
3. Pop elements when a condition is met or to maintain invariants.
