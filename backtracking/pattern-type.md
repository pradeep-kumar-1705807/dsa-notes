# Backtracking Pattern

Backtracking is a technique for solving problems incrementally, abandoning solutions that fail to satisfy constraints.

## Problem Patterns in Backtracking

- **Subsets and Combinations**
  - Subsets
  - Combination Sum
  - Combinations

- **Permutations**
  - Permutations
  - Permutations II

- **Constraint Satisfaction / N-Queens**
  - N-Queens
  - Sudoku Solver

- **Word Search and Path Finding**
  - Word Search
  - Robot Room Cleaner

- **Palindrome Partitioning**
  - Palindrome Partitioning

- **Expression Add Operators**
  - Expression Add Operators

## General Approach
1. Choose a possible option and proceed recursively.
2. If a constraint is violated, backtrack and try another option.
3. Continue until all solutions are found or the problem is solved.
