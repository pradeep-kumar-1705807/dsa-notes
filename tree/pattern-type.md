# Tree Pattern

Tree problems involve hierarchical data structures with parent-child relationships.

- **When to Use**: Problems involving binary trees, N-ary trees, or recursive structures.
- **Key Insight**: Use recursion or iterative traversal to process nodes.
- **Example Problems:**
  - Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
  - Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
  - Lowest Common Ancestor
  - Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
- **General Approach:**
  1. Traverse the tree using preorder, inorder, postorder, or level order.
  2. Use recursion or a stack/queue for traversal.
  3. Process nodes based on the problem's requirements.
