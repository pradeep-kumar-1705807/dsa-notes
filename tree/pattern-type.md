# Tree Pattern

Tree problems involve hierarchical data structures with parent-child relationships.

## Problem Patterns in Trees

- **Tree Traversal (Basic)**
  - Preorder, Inorder, Postorder Traversal
  - Level Order Traversal
  - Example Problems:
    - Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
    - Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
    - Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

- **Recursive Tree Problems (Basic/Intermediate)**
  - Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
  - Symmetric Tree
  - Path Sum

- **Lowest Common Ancestor (Intermediate)**
  - Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
  - Lowest Common Ancestor of a BST

- **Serialization/Deserialization (Advanced)**
  - Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

- **Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations (Intermediate/Advanced)**
  - Validate BST
  - Convert Sorted Array to BST
  - Kth Smallest Element in a BST

- **Diameter/Longest Path (Advanced)**
  - Diameter of Binary Tree

- **Tree Dynamic Programming (Advanced)**
  - House Robber III
  - Binary Tree Cameras

## General Approach
1. Traverse the tree using preorder, inorder, postorder, or level order.
2. Use recursion or a stack/queue for traversal.
3. Process nodes based on the problem's requirements.
