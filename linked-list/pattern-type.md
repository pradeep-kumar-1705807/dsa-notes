# Linked List Pattern

Linked list problems involve manipulating nodes in a singly or doubly linked list, often requiring careful pointer management.

## Problem Patterns in Linked Lists

- **Traversal and Basic Operations**
  - Print Linked List
  - Count Nodes

- **Insertion and Deletion**
  - Insert into Linked List
  - Delete Node in a Linked List

- **Reversal**
  - Reverse Linked List
  - Reverse Linked List II

- **Cycle Detection and Removal**
  - Linked List Cycle
  - Linked List Cycle II

- **Two Pointer/Fast & Slow Pointer**
  - Middle of the Linked List
  - Remove Nth Node From End of List

- **Merge and Sort**
  - Merge Two Sorted Lists
  - Merge k Sorted Lists
  - Sort List

- **Palindrome Check**
  - Palindrome Linked List

- **Intersection and Loop Problems**
  - Intersection of Two Linked Lists

- **Copy/Clone Linked List with Random Pointer**
  - Copy List with Random Pointer

- **Advanced Manipulations**
  - Rotate List
  - Reorder List
  - Swap Nodes in Pairs
  - Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List

## General Approach
1. Use one or more pointers to traverse the list.
2. Update next/prev pointers as needed for the operation.
3. Handle edge cases (empty list, single node, head/tail changes).
