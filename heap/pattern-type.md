# Heap Pattern

The heap pattern uses a priority queue (min-heap or max-heap) to efficiently retrieve the minimum or maximum element.

## Problem Patterns in Heaps

- **Top K Elements**
  - Kth Largest Element in an Array
  - Top K Frequent Elements
  - K Closest Points to Origin

- **Merge K Sorted Lists/Arrays**
  - Merge k Sorted Lists
  - Merge k Sorted Arrays

- **Sliding Window Maximum/Minimum**
  - Sliding Window Maximum
  - Sliding Window Median

- **Running Median / Median from Data Stream**
  - Find Median from Data Stream

- **Scheduling and Task Management**
  - Task Scheduler
  - Meeting Rooms II

- **Sort Nearly Sorted (K-Sorted) Array**
  - Sort a K Sorted Array

- **Minimum/Maximum Cost Problems**
  - Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks
  - Connect Ropes
  - Path With Minimum Effort

- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (Shortest Path)**
  - Network Delay Time
  - Path With Minimum Effort

- **Custom Heap with Tuples/Objects**
  - Reorganize String
  - Frequency Sort

## General Approach
1. Insert elements into the heap as needed.
2. Pop or peek the top element to get the min/max.
3. Maintain heap size or properties as required by the problem.
